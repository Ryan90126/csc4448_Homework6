Transaction Manager

By Ryan Murphy

This project was intended to make an android application that was similiar to Mint or a simple mobile banking app allowing user to sync, search 
visualize their transactions. Unfortunately it is not fully functtional as it turns out I am terrible at UI development and Android development 
in particular. I still encourage you to puruse the project especially the Data Layer where I was more successful. he data layer is seperated
out and in fact their are two different implementations of most of he datalayer I switched hoping to make the UI development easier.

I thank you for a great semester.

Installing and executing is probably a wased effort as it wont make it past the login screen it crashes shortly after howeve rif you wish to attempt
it you will need an android emulator preferably android studio.
